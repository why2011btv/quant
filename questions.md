Q2: 
In each round, there are two choices: 
  1) roll a 6-sided dice three times and get the sum;
  2) roll a 20-sided dice one time.

It's obvious that the two choices have the same expected value of 10.5. Now Alice and Bob play this game: each of them simultaneously chooses 1) or 2), accumulate the result on their own, and stop until one gets 500.
To get to 500 as quickly as possible, what strategy should be taken?
